## ‚úÖ What is a Signed URL in S3?

A **signed URL** is a **temporary, secure link** to access a **private object** in your S3 bucket.

### üîê It allows:

* Access to **private files** without making the bucket public.
* File downloads (GET), uploads (PUT/POST), or deletions (DELETE).
* **Time-limited access** using a cryptographic signature.

## ‚úÖ When to Use Signed URLs

| Use Case                  | Method                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Download a private file   | `GET` signed URL           |
| Upload a file to S3       | `PUT` or `POST` signed URL |
| Temporary, secure sharing | Signed URL (short expiry)  |

## ‚úÖ How to Generate a GET Signed URL using AWS CLI

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites:

* AWS CLI v2 installed
* IAM credentials configured with `s3:GetObject` permission
* Object already exists in the bucket

---

### üì¶ Example Command:

```bash
aws s3 presign s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/file.mp4 --expires-in 3600
```

üîó Output:

```
https://your-bucket-name.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/networking.webm?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=...&X-Amz-Date=...&X-Amz-Expires=1800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=...
```

You can share or open this link in a browser ‚Äî and it will download the file, **even if it‚Äôs private**.
