# 🌐 What is a CDN?

A **Content Delivery Network** (**CDN**) is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver content (like images, videos, scripts, and stylesheets) to users based on their geographic location.

## 🚀 How a CDN Works

1. **User Request**

   * A user visits your website or app and requests a file.

2. **Nearest Server**

   * The CDN finds the closest server (called an **edge location**) to the user.

3. **Quick Delivery**

   * The file is delivered from that nearby server, reducing load time and improving the user experience.

## 🎯 Benefits of a CDN

* **Faster Load Times** – Content is served from servers closer to the user, reducing latency.
* **Reduced Server Load** – Your main server (origin) handles fewer requests because CDN caches content.
* **Better Availability** – CDNs have multiple servers, so if one goes down, others can handle the load.
* **Global Reach** – Serve users efficiently anywhere in the world.
* **Security Features** – Many CDNs offer DDoS protection and secure delivery options.

## 💡 In Short

A CDN is like having **mini-warehouses** of your content all over the world. Instead of shipping from your main warehouse every time, you send content from the **nearest one** — making it faster, more reliable, and scalable.
