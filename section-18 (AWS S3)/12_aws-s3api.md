## 🧾 What is `aws s3api`?

`aws s3api` is the **low-level command** in the AWS CLI used to interact directly with the **Amazon S3 API**.

* It gives you **fine-grained control** over buckets and objects.
* It maps **1:1 with S3’s REST API operations**, allowing you to do anything you could via the AWS SDKs or REST endpoints.

> Think of it as the "raw power tool" version of working with S3.
