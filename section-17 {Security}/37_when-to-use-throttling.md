# When should we use Throttling?:

Applying throttling globally to all requests **can degrade performance unnecessarily**, especially for endpoints that:

* Are **already lightweight**
* Are used internally (e.g., health checks, metrics)
* Need to be fast

### 🔍 When to Apply Throttling (Best Practices)

| Apply Throttling To                                     | Avoid Throttling On         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Expensive operations (file uploads, DB writes)          | Static assets, simple reads |
| API endpoints with unpredictable usage                  | Health check routes         |
| Endpoints prone to abuse (e.g., login, form submission) | Internal/private routes     |
| Public APIs shared across users                         | Performance-critical flows  |

### 💡 Better Approach: **Targeted & Smart Throttling**

* Apply **route-level throttling** only where needed.
* Use **different thresholds** for different endpoints.
* Combine with **rate limiting** and **user/IP-based logic**.
* For logged-in users, you can throttle based on **user ID or session**, not IP.

### ✅ Conclusion:

> Throttling is a tool to **smooth spikes** and **protect resources**, not a blanket solution. Use it **surgically**, not globally.
