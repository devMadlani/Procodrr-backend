# 🎓 More Topics to Know

We've already covered a fantastic range of security topics! Here are additional areas worth exploring on your own to deepen and broaden your understanding:

---

## 🛡️ Network & Transport Attacks
- **Packet Sniffing** – Capturing network traffic to analyze data flow.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks** – Intercepting and altering communications between two parties.

---

## 🔐 Application-Layer Vulnerabilities
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**  
- **SSJI (Server-Side JavaScript Injection)**  
- **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)**  
- **Session Fixation** – Forcing a user to use a known session ID.

---

## 🧠 Security Architecture & Design
- **Defense in Depth** – Layered security controls to reduce risk.
- **Replay Attack Protection** – Preventing old requests from being reused.

---

## 🔍 Input Constraints & Hardening
- **File Upload Size Limit & Validation** – Prevent large or malicious uploads.
- **Sandboxed iframes** – Restricting third-party or untrusted content using `<iframe sandbox>`.

---

## 🧪 Code-Level Security Analysis
- **Security Linters** – Use tools like `eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`, and `eslint-plugin-prototype-pollution-security-rules` to catch insecure patterns like use of `eval`, unsanitized input, or prototype pollution early in development.
- **Semgrep** – A lightweight static analysis tool to enforce secure code patterns across JS, TS, and other languages.
- **SonarQube** – A powerful static analysis platform for detecting security hotspots, code smells, and vulnerabilities in codebases during CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🌐 Infrastructural Defenses
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** – Filtering and blocking suspicious traffic.
- **Security Testing Tools** – Hands-on practice with **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite**, etc.

---

## ✅ Compliance & Governance
- **Security Compliance Frameworks** – Understanding GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001.
- **Secure SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)** best practices.
