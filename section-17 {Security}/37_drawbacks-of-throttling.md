# ⚠️ **Drawbacks of Throttling**

### 1. 🐢 **Slower User Experience**
- Throttling introduces **delays**, which can frustrate users — especially if they’re used to faster responses.
- Even though requests aren’t blocked, slower responses can hurt perceived performance.

---

### 2. ❌ **Can Cause Unintended Side Effects**
- Throttled API calls may **timeout** or **fail** on the client if not handled properly.
- Mobile apps or frontends may misinterpret slow responses as connectivity issues.

---

### 3. 🔄 **Retry Storms**
- If throttling isn’t combined with **retry logic and backoff strategies**, clients might keep retrying too aggressively, making the problem worse.

---

### 4. 🧠 **Adds System Complexity**
- Requires additional logic to track and manage request rates (per IP, user, route, etc.).
- May require **persistent storage** (like Redis) in distributed systems.

---

### 5. ⚖️ **Hard to Tune Properly**
- Setting the right thresholds is tricky:
  - Too strict → app feels sluggish.
  - Too lenient → no real benefit.
- Needs monitoring, tweaking, and sometimes adaptive algorithms to be effective.

---

### 6. 🧪 **Can Interfere with Testing & Monitoring**
- Throttling can limit legitimate test scripts, bots, or monitoring tools.
- You’ll need to **whitelist** or **bypass** it for trusted services.

## 👎 Summary Table

| Drawback                      | Description                                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Slower UX                    | Adds delays that may annoy users                |
| Timeout/Errors               | Can cause unexpected client-side failures       |
| Retry Loops                  | Risk of clients retrying and overloading server |
| Complexity                   | Requires more code and monitoring               |
| Hard to Fine-Tune            | Thresholds must be adjusted with care           |
| Testing Conflicts            | Can disrupt automated tests and monitoring      |

### ✅ Bottom Line:
> Throttling is powerful — but like any tool, it should be **used with intention**. Apply it **selectively**, monitor its impact, and always **test user experience** under throttled conditions.
