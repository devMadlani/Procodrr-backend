# Difference Between Rate Limiting and Throttling

When designing APIs or managing traffic to services, it's essential to control the number of requests made to prevent abuse, ensure stability, and maintain performance. Two commonly used strategies for this are **rate limiting** and **throttling**. While often used interchangeably, they have distinct purposes and implementations.

## Rate Limiting

**Rate limiting** is a technique used to restrict the number of requests a client can make to a server in a specific time window.

### Key Points:

- It defines a maximum number of requests allowed (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).
- Once the limit is reached, further requests are **denied** until the time window resets.
- Typically enforced at the API gateway or reverse proxy level.

### Example:

Allow only 100 requests per minute from a single IP address. If the client exceeds this, they receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Throttling

**Throttling** is a technique used to control the **rate** of requests over time, not denying them, but rather **slowing them down**.

### Key Points:

- It allows requests but introduces **delays** between them.
- Prevents a sudden spike in traffic by spreading the load evenly.
- Useful for ensuring fair usage and protecting backend resources.

### Example:

If a user is allowed to send 1 request every 2 seconds, any additional request made before the 2-second window may be queued or delayed.

## Summary Table

| Feature  | Rate Limiting                     | Throttling                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Restrict total number of requests | Control the pace of requests        |
| Behavior | Reject excess requests            | Delay or queue excess requests      |
| Use Case | Prevent abuse or DoS attacks      | Smooth traffic, avoid sudden bursts |
| Response | 429 error when limit is exceeded  | Responses are delayed               |

## Conclusion

Both rate limiting and throttling are crucial for building resilient systems. While rate limiting is strict and focused on rejecting overuse, throttling is more flexible and focused on smoothing request patterns. Often, a combination of both is used for comprehensive traffic management.
