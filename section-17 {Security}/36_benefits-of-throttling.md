## ✅ **Benefits of Throttling**

### 1. 🛡 **Protects Backend Resources**

* Prevents your server, database, or third-party APIs from being overwhelmed.
* Reduces the risk of crashes or degraded performance during sudden traffic spikes.

### 2. 📉 **Smooths Out Traffic Spikes**

* Instead of allowing bursts of requests all at once, it spaces them out over time.
* Ensures **more consistent load** on your infrastructure.

### 3. 🔁 **Improves Reliability & Uptime**

* Reduces the chance of cascading failures caused by overloaded services.
* Keeps your app responsive for most users, even under stress.

### 4. 👥 **Ensures Fair Usage**

* Prevents one user from hogging resources at the expense of others.
* Useful in multi-tenant systems and public APIs.

### 5. 🔒 **Reduces Risk of Abuse**

* Helps defend against **brute force attacks**, **spam bots**, or **scripted abuse**.
* Slows down repeated attempts on sensitive routes like login, signup, OTP verification, etc.

### 6. 💡 **Works Alongside Rate Limiting**

* While rate limiting blocks requests over a limit, throttling **gracefully slows them down**.
* Helps maintain user experience by not rejecting every extra request.
