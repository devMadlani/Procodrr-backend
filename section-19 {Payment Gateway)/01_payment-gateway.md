## 📌 What is a Payment Gateway?

A **payment gateway** is a service that allows businesses to securely accept digital payments such as cards, UPI, wallets, and net banking. Think of it as a **bridge** between the customer, the bank, and the business.

💰 For this service, payment gateways usually charge 2–5% of every transaction as processing fees.

## 🤔 Why Do We Need Payment Gateways?

* Without them, businesses would need to directly connect with banks, handle card data, encryption, and fraud detection — which is very complex and heavily regulated.
* Gateways handle:

  * 🔐 Card data security (PCI-DSS compliance)
  * 🏦 Multi-bank integrations
  * 🛡️ Fraud detection and 2FA (OTP, 3DSecure)
  * 💸 Refunds, disputes, and chargebacks
  * 💰 Settlements into your bank account

👉 This means developers and businesses can focus on growth instead of banking compliance.

## 🚫 Why Can’t We Build Our Own Gateway Easily?

* ⚖️ Regulatory hurdles: RBI license is required (Payment Aggregator license)
* 💰 High entry barrier: ₹15–25 crore net worth requirement in India
* 🏦 Must maintain escrow accounts for customer funds
* 🔐 PCI DSS compliance, tokenisation, and dispute resolution systems
* ⏱️ Huge operational and financial overhead

➡️ For indie developers and most startups, it’s impractical to build a gateway from scratch.
