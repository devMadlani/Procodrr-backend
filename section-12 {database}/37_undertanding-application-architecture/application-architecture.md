# Understanding 1-Tier, 2-Tier, and 3-Tier Architecture

When building software applications, understanding the architecture is crucial. The architecture determines how the components of an application (UI, logic, and data) are distributed and interact. Below, we explore **One-Tier**, **Two-Tier**, and **Three-Tier Architecture**.

## **1. One-Tier Architecture**

In **one-tier architecture**, all components of the application (UI, business logic, and data) exist on the **same system or environment**. It is the simplest form of application architecture.

### **Key Features**

- All processes run on the same machine.
- Typically used in standalone applications.
- Suitable for simple use cases where scalability is not required.

### **Examples**

- A calculator application.
- A text editor like Notepad.
- Offline mobile apps storing data locally.
- A basic HTML/CSS/JS site using `localStorage` for data persistence.

## **2. Two-Tier Architecture**

In **two-tier architecture**, the application is divided into two layers:

1. **Client (Presentation Layer):** Handles the user interface.
2. **Server (Data Layer):** Handles database or data storage and processing.

The client communicates directly with the server. This architecture is often called **client-server architecture**.

### **Key Features**

- The logic and data are processed on the server, while the UI is handled on the client.
- The client and server communicate over a network (e.g., via HTTP or database queries).
- Better scalability than one-tier but limited flexibility.

### **Examples**

- Our StorageApp before integrating the database.
- Legacy Desktop App with Direct Database Connection

## **3. Three-Tier Architecture**

In **three-tier architecture**, the application is divided into three distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer (Client):** Handles the UI and user interaction.
2. **Application Layer (Logic):** Contains the business logic and processing.
3. **Data Layer (Database):** Manages and stores the data.

This architecture introduces an **application layer** between the client and the database. The client never interacts directly with the database.

### **Key Features**

- Separation of concerns: Each layer is independent and easier to maintain.
- Highly scalable and suitable for large, distributed systems.
- Common in modern web applications and enterprise software.

### **Examples**

- A web application with:
  - Frontend (React, Angular) → **Presentation Layer**
  - Backend (Node.js, Django) → **Application Layer**
  - Database (MongoDB, MySQL) → **Data Layer**
- Our StorageApp after integrating the database.
